## Spikot: Framework for spigot written in Kotlin
Spikot is a framework to use Kotlin in spigot. Spikot provide vary features like command, inventory, persistence which
is designed kotlin friendly. Spikot help plugin developer to focus on what plugin does rather than how plugin work.

## Key features
### Kotlin first
Kotlin is programming language developed by Jetbrains. Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java. Kotlin make code shorter and readable in short time. Every source code in spikot is written in kotlin and all api is designed to maximize the power of kotlin. Kotlin dsl style code also make you say good bye to builer and method chaining.

### Coroutine support

Coroutine is how kotlin handle asynchronous. Coroutine makes asynchronous code look like synchronous code, which is much more understandable than reactive stream or callback. Spikot use coroutine in every asynchronous api or blocking api to simplify event handling, file handling, or user interaction.

### Extendability

Extendability is top priority of spikot. All api in spikot is designed carefully to maximize extendability to provide maximum configurability to spikot user. 

## Notice
Spikot is entirely rewritten and original repository move to [SpikotLegacy](https://github.com/Spikot/SpikotLegacy)
